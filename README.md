# IMDb analysis For Top Movies and Series

This project aims to collect data for top movies and TV shows, clean and prepare the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Plotly, and build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering with cosine similarity. Additionally, a dashboard will be created using Plotly Dash and deployed on Render..

## Features
## Overview

The project workflow involves several stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Using Selenium and concurrent.futures to gather data on top movies and TV shows from a chosen source.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Utilizing Pandas and NumPy to clean and prepare the collected data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting EDA using Plotly to gain insights into the dataset.
4. **Recommendation System**: Building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering with cosine similarity from scikit-learn.
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Developing a dashboard using Plotly Dash to visualize the findings.
6. **Deployment**: Deploying the dashboard on Render for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium**: For web scraping.
- **concurrent.futures**: For concurrent processing of web scraping tasks.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Plotly**: For interactive data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For building the recommendation system.
- **Plotly Dash**: For creating web-based interactive dashboards.
- **Render**: For deploying the dashboard.
